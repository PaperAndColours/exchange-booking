DONE: +Correct redirection
--------------------
(Maybe done, another issue pending)
So front page goes straight to calendar. Perhaps no /calendar/, but everything goes to front page except overview

Front page = is user signed in ? calendar page : signin page
Calendar page = is user signed in ? calendar page : signin page
Overview page = is user signed in ? calendar page : signin page

Booking/room api = is user signed in ? make request : don't make request

DONE: +Resource path
--------------
DONE: Fixed by displaying absolute paths
main.js seems to sometimes call calendar/whatever, and sometimes /whatever from ajax calls
Post onto SO about bug where resources address changes

DONE: Javascript/Bower
----------------
DONE: Make sure all javascript and bower will work in the correct directories

DONE: +Heroku
--------------------
DONE:Upload app onto heroku and make sure it works
DONE:Make sure bower/js component DL properly

DONE:+Create front page with login form
---------------------------------------
DONE: Login form created

DONE: +Validation (Back end)
----------
Add validation for user submitted values
	Booking form values
		DONE: Dates in order
		Check javascript for other details
	Charge values
I think the other stuff is basically covered by the "type" property

DONE: +Calendar Navigation
--------------------
Make clicking on a day in the calendar jump straight to that day

DONE:+<Enter> when entering fee
------------------------
Currently deletes current fee, needs to change
Look in table library?
It's because it is auto-clicking the delete button

DONE: +Confirmation upon delete
-------------------------
Confirmation box comes on event/fee delete

DONE: +Updating pushes back 1 hour
----------------------------
DONE:wtf?
Turns out it was because of BST + moment. Needed to use moment.utc()

Make sure calendar reverts. when server operation not successful

------------------------------------------
Disable multi-room bookings. - Make it so each room requires a seperate box
(Seems to work)
	Where are the references?:
		-Model:
			-The model itself (x)
			-The resource virtual function? Yes - this might have a reference to an array instead of a single object (x)
		-The python script - make sure supplying a individual item to bookingCreate(), and perhaps other functions
		-Saving: 
			The controller? no, this just forwards
			The resource-view js? no, this just loads from virtual resources


Make sure a single resource is required, after multi-room bookings have been disabled
