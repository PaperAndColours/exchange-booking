#===Front end=================
Connection lost - Don't delete events from screen
-------------------------------------------------

A.k.a. update events color manually - Just color I think
Switch to fulcallendar.updateEvent()

Connection lost - continuously retry to connect
-----------------------------------------------
Perhaps try to reconnect several times, after a delay, and if it doesn't work after say 5 times, then display an error message
DONE: Display a message explaining connection lost

	Include provisional bookings
	Start date + end date filter
	Show past, show pending
	Export to CVS

		Show provisional: [x]
		Show fees breakdown: [x]
		
		
		Client		Booking Date/Room	Fees			Provisional Total			Confirmed Total		Total
	March												£35.00						£45.00				£80.00
