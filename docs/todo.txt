-----------
Add jquery menu
Center styles properly

//Optional:

Add month selection calendar
----------------------------
On the top panel

Refresh
-------
Remove the need to refetch every time there is an update?
Mostly just fix colors

Connection lost - Don't delete events from screen
-------------------------------------------------
Change refetchupdates() so that it doesn't have to refetch the updates, just modify the ones being modified
A.k.a. update events color manually - Just color I think
Switch to fulcallendar.updateEvent()

Connection lost - continuously retry to connect
-----------------------------------------------
Perhaps try to reconnect several times, after a delay, and if it doesn't work after say 5 times, then display an error message
DONE: Display a message explaining connection lost

Tidy javascript file
---------------------
Create functions to manipulate dates

Form UI  (very optional)
-------
(Do I need all this? I've got form validation)
	Make it impossible to select an end date before the start date
	Make end date automatically update to startdate when start > end
	Same with time:
		Make it imposible to select an end time before the start time
		Make end time automatically update when start > end
		(Triggered when: times changed, days changed to line up)

No double bookings (maybe better without)
------------------
	-front end.. flag?
	..Events don't overlap (Can i get calendar to do this for me?)
