+Update/Save
-----------
Make sure all of the functionality is working okay
	Just browse through, make sure it is okay.. refresh knowledge of the code, the different methods
	Document javascript

#===Front end=================
+AllDay Issues
------------
Find out why dialog is clearing when all day event is checked
It's clearing because there is a single property for "allDay" that doesn't take specific events into account, i don't think.

It needs to be changed so that it also updates when a new event loads, to take into account the status of the individual event.
Also, it could be a slightly more generic method. It can be invoked by addEvent, updateEvent, and allDay.click?
Create a set of methods that can be used to turn on/off extra (or allday) date information when it's clicked)?
DISABLE Allday & delete the becursed code which drove me here

+Confirmation upon delete
-------------------------
Make sure confirmation box comes on event/fee delete

+Time Length Issues
-------------------
Find out why display box is no longer showing length of time

Streamline loading / saving functions and integrate with list of variables
