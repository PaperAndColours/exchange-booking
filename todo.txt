+Update/Save
-----------
Make sure all of the functionality is working okay
	Just browse through, make sure it is okay.. refresh knowledge of the code, the different methods
	Document javascript

#===Front end=================
+AllDay Issues
------------
Find out why dialog is clearing when all day event is checked
It's clearing because there is a single property for "allDay" that doesn't take specific events into account, i don't think.

It needs to be changed so that it also updates when a new event loads, to take into account the status of the individual event.
Also, it could be a slightly more generic method. It can be invoked by addEvent, updateEvent, and allDay.click?
Create a set of methods that can be used to turn on/off extra (or allday) date information when it's clicked)?

+Form Reflects Updated Model
----------------------------
Make forms reflect the new updated model:
	A way to add costs
	!IN PROGRESS: A description textarea box
	Make client the main heading.. -And remove the event title heading (Unless already fixed with a serverside virtual )

No double bookings
------------------
	-front end.. flag?

+Finances display
-----------------
Create a screen to display finances, with breakdowns
Click on day in month view = select day

Payload
-------
Change to using event object directly, to remove the need to list the variables separately

+Revert
------
Make sure calendar reverts. when server operation not successful
-Make sure update/save methods return success or failure
Fix the bug outlined here: http://www.ikelin.com/fullcalendar-resource-day-view-bug/

Front End Form Validation 
-------------------------
	..Events don't overlap (Can i get calendar to do this for me?)

Refresh
-------
Remove the need to refetch every time there is an update?

Form UI 
-------
(Do I need all this? I've got form validation)
	Make it impossible to select an end date before the start date
	Make end date automatically update to startdate when start > end
	Same with time:
		Make it imposible to select an end time before the start time
		Make end time automatically update when start > end
		(Triggered when: times changed, days changed to line up)

#=========Back end===========
+Revise Booking model
--------------------
Each booking needs extra information:
	1. Description field
	2. Cost breakdown
	3. Boolean for provisional? (Whether they have been confirmed with booking form)

And remove this field:
	Title

Add cost for rooms

Possibly create virtual for title to map to client
Possibly rename _resources to monRooms, to make easier to comprehend..

Create user authentication

Queries

Use the queries generated by the calendar for fetching
