Disable multi-room bookings. - Make it so each room requires a seperate box
(Seems to work)
	Where are the references?:
		-Model:
			-The model itself (x)
			-The resource virtual function? Yes - this might have a reference to an array instead of a single object (x)
		-The python script - make sure supplying a individual item to bookingCreate(), and perhaps other functions
		-Saving: 
			The controller? no, this just forwards
			The resource-view js? no, this just loads from virtual resources


Make sure a single resource is required, after multi-room bookings have been disabled
